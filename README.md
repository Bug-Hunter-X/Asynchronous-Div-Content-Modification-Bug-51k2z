This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to asynchronous script execution when modifying the content of a div element. The main issue is that the script's execution happens after the initial page load, and the changes might not be immediately reflected in the DOM.  The bug.html file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.html provides the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of understanding asynchronous operations in JavaScript and how they interact with HTML DOM manipulation.
